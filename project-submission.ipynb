A simple `conda update --all` that I run every single morning ended up bricking JupyterLab and Spyder IDE for me. After deleting and reinstalling Anaconda, and spending hours trying to find a solution, I ended up fixing the issue by simply downgrading my version of Python from 3.6.5 back down to 3.6.4. \n",

    "    > Although I have created a 2-D RPG game in Java before, Python and pygame made the experience much more enjoyable. In addition, I was very impressed with the overall performance of the game, given the Python is not exactly made for video game development. I can unequivocally say that R and Matlab would not have been the right tools for the job in the case of this project."

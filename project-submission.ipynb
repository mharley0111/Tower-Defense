Using pygame, we were easily able to utlize those spritesheets to have our game objects move in a realistic manner. Furthermore, using pygame, we were easily able to detect if and when certain objects would collide with one another. For instance, during our update state, we would check if any zombies collided with any of the bullets that were shot by any of the towers placed on the screen. Finally, we relied on pygame to draw all of our objects to the screen with every iteration of the main game loop. \n"

A simple `conda update --all` that I run every single morning ended up bricking JupyterLab and Spyder IDE for me. After deleting and reinstalling Anaconda, and spending hours trying to find a solution, I ended up fixing the issue by simply downgrading my version of Python from 3.6.5 back down to 3.6.4. \n",

In addition, I was very impressed with the overall performance of the game, given the Python is not exactly made for video game development. I can unequivocally say that R and Matlab would not have been the right tools for the job in the case of this project."
